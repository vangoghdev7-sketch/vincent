"""Issue #199 (tg12): GDELT military incident ingestion must use HTTPS.

The previous code fetched ``http://data.gdeltproject.org/gdeltv2/lastupdate.txt``
and ~48 export archives over plaintext HTTP, which let a passive observer
identify Vincent OS nodes by their fetch pattern and let an active MITM
inject doctored export records into the global incident map.

These tests assert the URL constants and outbound URL constructor in
``services/geopolitics.py`` only use HTTPS.
