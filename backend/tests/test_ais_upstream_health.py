"""AIS upstream-connectivity telemetry.

Background
----------
On 2026-05-23, stream.aisstream.io went fully offline (TCP timeouts on port
443). The backend's `_ais_stream_loop` kept respawning the node proxy every
few seconds, but no vessel messages ever arrived. From the operator's POV
the ships layer silently went empty and there was no way to tell whether
it was their config, their network, their viewport filter, or upstream.

The fix surfaces three signals from ``ais_proxy_status()``:

  * ``connected`` — bool, true when we received a vessel message in the
    last ``_AIS_CONNECTED_FRESHNESS_S`` seconds.
  * ``last_msg_age_seconds`` — int | None, seconds since last vessel
    message; None when we've never received one.
  * ``proxy_spawn_count`` — int, how many times we've spawned the node
    proxy. Sustained increase without ``connected`` means upstream is dead.

Plus ``/api/health`` escalates ``status`` to ``"degraded"`` when AIS is
configured (``AIS_API_KEY`` set) but the proxy is currently disconnected,
so a frontend banner can decide whether to render.

These tests pin every signal.
