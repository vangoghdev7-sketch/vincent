# Vincent — Meshtastic MQTT Remediation

**Version:** 0.9.6  
**Date:** 2026-04-12  
**Re:** [meshtastic/firmware#6131](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/issues/6131) — Excessive MQTT traffic from Vincent clients

---

## What happened

Vincent is an open-source OSINT situational awareness platform that includes a Meshtastic MQTT listener for displaying mesh network activity on a global map. In prior versions, the MQTT bridge:

- Subscribed to **28 wildcard topics** (`msh/{region}/#`) covering every known official and community root on startup
- Used an aggressive reconnect policy (min 1s / max 30s backoff)
- Set keepalive to 30 seconds
- Had no client-side rate limiting on inbound messages
- Auto-started on every launch with no opt-out

This produced 1-2 orders of magnitude more traffic than typical Meshtastic clients on the public broker at `mqtt.meshtastic.org`.

---

## What we fixed

### 1. Bridge disabled by default

The MQTT bridge no longer starts automatically. Operators must explicitly opt in:

```env
MESH_MQTT_ENABLED=true
```

### 2. US-only default subscription

When enabled, the bridge subscribes to **1 topic** (`msh/US/#`) instead of 28. Additional regions are opt-in:

```env
MESH_MQTT_EXTRA_ROOTS=EU_868,ANZ
```

The UI still displays all regions in its dropdown — only the MQTT subscription scope changed.

### 3. Client-side rate limiter

Inbound messages are capped at **100 messages per minute** using a sliding window. Excess messages are silently dropped. A warning is logged periodically when the limiter activates so operators are aware.

### 4. Conservative connection parameters

| Parameter | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Keepalive | 30s | 120s |
| Reconnect min delay | 1s | 15s |
| Reconnect max delay | 30s | 300s |
| QoS | 0 | 0 (unchanged) |

### 5. Versioned client ID

Client IDs changed from `sbmesh-{uuid}` to `sb096-{uuid}` so the Meshtastic team can identify Vincent clients and track adoption of the fix by version.
